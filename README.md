SAVI-Perl is a Perl module interface to the Sophos SAVI API. It was developed
to integrate the Sophos antivirus engine into amavisd-new. While I believe that
Sophos still sells that product, this package has not been maintained for ages,
as once upon a time Sophos tried to considerably jack up our licensing costs
and we said screw you guys we are switching to ClamAV.
