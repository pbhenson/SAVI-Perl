Introduction
------------

SAVI-Perl is a Perl module interface to the Sophos Anti-Virus engine. It
allows you to scan files for viruses directly from Perl.


Installation
------------

In order to successfully compile and use SAVI-Perl, you must have already
acquired and installed the Sophos Anti-Virus software and API. Information
about these products can be found at

     http://www.sophos.com/products/software/


If the Sophos library is not in the default search path, edit Makefile.PL
and update the -L and -R options appropriately.

After meeting the prerequisites, run the following commands to
compile/install:

     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make install


The file scan.pl in the example directory demonstrates how to use the
module to initialize the engine, determine version information, set
options, and scan files for viruses. The module also contains some
documentation, accessible via either 'man SAVI' or 'perldoc SAVI' after
installation.


Changes
-------

0.10 - Calling $results->viruses() if the scanned file was not infected
       would result in a segmentation violation. While from a pedantic
       point of view you just really shouldn't do that ;), an empty
       list will now be returned in this case.

     - Added new method $savi->error_string(code) to return a message
       corresponding to the given error code. Updated sample script to
       demonstrate use.

     - Add simple test script to prevent complaints from
       cpan-testers@perl.org :). 


0.05 - First publicly released version.
